<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Piston Pins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-floating</li><li>Fully Floating</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Piston pins, essential components in internal combustion engines, are categorized into three main types: semi-floating, fully floating, and others. Semi-floating piston pins are secured at one end, allowing limited movement within the connecting rod. Fully floating pins are not fixed, enabling free rotation within both the piston and connecting rod, enhancing lubrication and reducing wear. Other types may include press-fit or snap-fit designs, catering to specific engine requirements and performance needs. Each type influences engine efficiency and durability.</p></p>
